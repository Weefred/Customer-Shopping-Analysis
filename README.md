### About

This project involves analyzing a sales dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and purchasing patterns within a retail environment. The project aims to extract actionable insights that can be leveraged to optimize marketing strategies, enhance inventory management and business decision-making, hence improving overall business performance.

### Business Problem

Businesses are presented with an opportunity to optimize their operations, marketing strategies, and product offerings to better cater to the diverse consumer base in Istanbul. However, they face the challenge of effectively leveraging this dataset to drive actionable insights and make informed decisions.

### Solution

- I will utilize SQL by leveraging its querying capabilities to extract relevant data from the dataset, filtering by various criteria such as time periods, customer demographics, product categories and shopping mall locations.
  
-	Then, I'll use Power BI to visualize the data, generating insightful charts and dashboards to uncover shopping trends and patterns.

  Approach Used

1.	**Data Wrangling**: This process involved checking for duplicate values, correcting errors, inconsistencies and using the right data types.
   
2.	**Feature Engineering**: This involved creating new columns from existing ones. The new columns created include:
   
a.	**year**:  The different years 2021, 2022, 2023 were extracted from the invoice date column to conduct an annual sales analysis.

b.	**month_name**: The month in which the transaction took place was derived from the date column. This information enables the determination of which month of the year records the highest sales and profit.

c.	**day of week**: Also obtained from invoice date, this information helps to determine which days of the week recorded the highest and lowest sales.

d.	**age_group**: The age brackets (18-24), (25-34), (35-44), etc. was created to allow for a customer- based analysis.

e.	**revenue**: This column was created from the price and quantity columns.

4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory data analysis was done to answer the vital business questions to identify relationships between variables and extract meaningful insights.
